# Jumble Jam

Jumble Jam is an iOS application that creates slider puzzles from images.  Users can select from 40+ beautiful images that come bundled with the game for free or use their own image from their personal Photo Library or Camera.  

The application is designed to work in portrait mode for iPhones.  The formatting was designed to work on an iPhone 5SE with auto-layout constraints that should adapt to other iPhone shapes accordingly.

* custom splashcreen
* settings bundle to manage user preferences
* shake motion to jumble puzzle pieces on demand
* button to solve the puzzle on demand
* custom data structures to manage game data
* extension files to add functionality
* animations
